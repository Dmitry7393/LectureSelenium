AndroidWD is a test application for Android port of WebDriver

To run AndroidWD on real device or emulator:
    -- copy on device AndroidWD.apk and install;
    -- run AndroidWD;
After start of AndroidWD the screen will be black(No UI will be shown). In tests AndroidWD could be used like any other driver.

To test application on device connected via usb or on emulator you should do next steps:
    -- install Android SDK;
    -- enable developer mode in settings; //only for device
    -- connect via usb to PC; //only for device
    -- using adb (android debug bridge from Android SDK) make port forwarding
        ./adb forward tcp:9517 tcp:9517
    -- from test connect to http://127.0.0.1:9517;

Currently AndroiWD supports only two view types Widgets and QML (Quick2).

There is two ways to use AndroidWD with QML:
    1. Use webserver that could provide qml files to test;
    2. Place qml files to the device or emulator;

To use WebDriver with custom Widgets or complex QML/C++ application you need build your own apk.
The easiest way to do this is to use QtCreator.
    1. Create new project;
    2. add dependencies for next libs (should be built with the same version of Qt): 
        - libWebDriver_extension_qt_quick.a,
        - libWebDriver_extension_qt_base.a,
        - libWebDriver_core.a, 
        - libchromium_base.a
        - mongoose (library or add source to project);
    3. add necessary config dependencies in pro-file:
         QT       += core gui qml quick multimedia multimediawidgets
    4. Implement main function. (see example in src/Test/main.cc)
    5. Register necessary Widget classes;
    6. Build and Run (in QtCreator 2.8.1 apk is generated in "run" step; to have ability to run generated apk on device in release mode you need to specify keystore in project run configuration).
